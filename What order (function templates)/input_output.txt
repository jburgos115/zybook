Define a generic function called CheckOrder() that checks if four items are in ascending, neither, or descending order. The function should return -1 if the items are in ascending order, 0 if the items are unordered, and 1 if the items are in descending order.

The program reads four items from input and outputs if the items are ordered. The items can be different types, including integers, strings, characters, or doubles.

Ex. If the input is:

bat hat mat sat
63.2 96.5 100.1 123.5

the output is:

Order: -1
Order: -1
