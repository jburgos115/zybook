Write a recursive function called PrintNumPattern() to output the following number pattern.

Given a positive integer as input (Ex: 12), subtract another positive integer (Ex: 3) continually until 0 or a negative value is reached, and then continually add the second integer until the first integer is again reached.

Ex. If the input is:

12
3

the output is:

12 9 6 3 0 3 6 9 12
