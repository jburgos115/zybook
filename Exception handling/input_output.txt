The given program reads a list of single-word first names and ages (ending with -1), and outputs that list with the age incremented. The program fails and throws an exception if the second input on a line is a string rather than an int. At FIXME in the code, add a try/catch statement to catch ios_base::failure, and output 0 for the age.

Ex: If the input is:

Lee 18
Lua 21
Mary Beth 19
Stu 33
-1

then the output is:

Lee 19
Lua 22
Mary 0
Stu 34
