Write a program that lists all ways people can line up for a photo (all permutations of a list of strings). The program will read a list of one word names (until -1), and use a recursive method to create and output all possible orderings of those names, one ordering per line.

When the input is:

Julia Lucas Mia -1

then the output is (must match the below ordering):

Julia Lucas Mia 
Julia Mia Lucas 
Lucas Julia Mia 
Lucas Mia Julia 
Mia Julia Lucas 
Mia Lucas Julia
