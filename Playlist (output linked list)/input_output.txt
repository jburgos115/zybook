Given main(), complete the SongNode class to include the function PrintSongInfo(). Then write the PrintPlaylist() function in main.cpp to print all songs in the playlist. DO NOT print the dummy head node.

Ex: If the input is:

Stomp!
380
The Brothers Johnson
The Dude
337
Quincy Jones
You Don't Own Me
151
Lesley Gore

the output is:
